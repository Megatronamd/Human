                    <h3>The Overthinking Olympics</h3>
                    <p>Someone once told me, “Don’t overthink it.” 🤔 I wish I could, but my brain treats every minor situation like a full-scale investigation 🔍🕵️‍♀️. Did I sound rude in that text? 😬 Was that laugh too fake? Why did my boss say “We need to talk” instead of “Hey”? By the time I’m done analyzing, I’ve created five alternate timelines 🔁 and three conspiracy theories 🧩 — and I’m emotionally exhausted 😅. Meanwhile, the person I’m worried about has completely forgotten the conversation. I don’t need therapy; I need a pause button for my brain ⏸️🧠.</p>

                    <h3>The Monday Curse</h3>
                    <p>Mondays should honestly come with a warning label ⚠️📅. No matter how early I sleep on Sunday, Monday still feels like getting hit by a truck full of responsibilities 🚚😫. My alarm goes off ⏰, and I swear it’s personal — the coffee doesn’t hit ☕️, the Wi‑Fi lags 📶, and somehow every email begins with “As per my last message,” which basically means “Did you even read what I said?” By noon I’m negotiating with myself — “If I survive today, I’ll eat vegetables for dinner” 🥦. Spoiler: I order pizza 🍕 and cry a little 😂.</p>

                    <h3>Coffee Before Humanity</h3>
                    <p>I don’t talk to anyone before my morning coffee. Not because I’m rude — but because I’m basically a Windows 98 computer trying to boot up 🖥️💤. If someone asks me a serious question before caffeine, I just blink in buffering mode ⏳😵‍💫. Once, I accidentally replied “I love you” to my boss when he said “Good morning,” simply because I hadn’t had coffee yet 😳☕️. My coworkers know the rule now: don’t approach me until the mug is at least half empty. After that, I’m nice — still tired 😴, but nice 😊.</p>

                    <h3>The Online Meeting Disaster</h3>
                    <p>There’s always that one moment in an online meeting when your camera freezes at the worst possible angle 📸💻. Everyone else looks professional, and I’m stuck mid-blink, looking like I’m questioning the meaning of life 🤨. Then the audio lags, and I end up saying “Good morning” right when someone else says it too — and we both laugh awkwardly for five minutes 😂😅. Once, I thought I was muted 🔇, said “Finally, this meeting is over,” and immediately heard my boss reply, “Not yet.” I’ve never prayed faster in my life 🙏😬.</p>

                    <h3>The Laundry Mystery</h3>
                    <p>I don’t know where socks go after laundry day, but I’m convinced there’s a secret sock dimension 🧦✨🌌. I put ten pairs in and get nine and a half back. Somewhere out there, a sock is living its best life, free from responsibility, dancing in a dryer paradise 💃🧺. Meanwhile, I have a drawer full of single socks, each waiting for a reunion that will never happen 😭. I’ve started mixing them intentionally — if my socks can’t find love, at least they can have chaos 🎲😉.</p>

                    <h3>The Dinner Dilemma</h3>
                    <p>Every night it’s the same question: “What should I eat?” 🍽️ I open the fridge hoping for inspiration, but all I find are condiments and disappointment 🥫😔. I’ll stand there staring like food’s going to magically appear if I believe hard enough ✨. Eventually, I order takeout 🥡, wait 45 minutes ⏱️, and then fall asleep five minutes before it arrives 😴. The next morning, I wake up to a cold burger 🍔 and think, “Maybe this is who I am now — the person who eats leftovers at 7 a.m.” Honestly, it’s a lifestyle 😅.</p>

                    <h3>The Backseat GPS</h3>
                    <p>Nothing tests a friendship quite like giving directions while someone else drives 🚗🗺️. I’ll say “Turn left,” and they’ll immediately go right ➡️. Then they look at me like I’m the problem. I try to sound calm — “No worries, we can take the scenic route” — but inside, I’m screaming 😱. My favorite is when they ignore the GPS completely, saying, “I know a shortcut,” and that shortcut somehow adds 25 minutes to the trip ⌛🧭. Next time, I’m letting the GPS talk. At least it doesn’t take things personally 🤷‍♂️.</p>

                <article class="poem-card" data-title="The Accidental Call" aria-label="The Accidental Call">
                    <h3>The Accidental Call</h3>
                    <p>There’s no horror quite like realizing you’ve accidentally called someone 📱😰. You’re just scrolling through your phone, and suddenly you hear it ringing 📲. Panic sets in — do you hang up? Do you wait? If they answer, what do you even say? “Oh hey, sorry, I pressed your face by mistake”? 😬 I once accidentally called my boss at 11 p.m. — I didn’t even breathe until he texted, “Everything okay?” No sir, nothing’s okay. My thumbs are a danger to society 🫠😳.</p>

                    <h3>The Modern Love War</h3>
                    <p>Texting in relationships is an Olympic event 🏅💌. You spend 20 minutes crafting the perfect message — cute but not desperate, funny but not too try-hard — then they reply with <b>“hmm.”</b> 😶 Just three letters. I’ve seen Wi‑Fi signals stronger than that energy 📶. Then comes the typing bubble... and it disappears. What were they going to say? Did they delete it? Are they ghosting me 👻 or just busy? By the time they reply again, I’ve imagined 46 different breakup scenarios 💭💔. Texting isn’t communication anymore — it’s emotional dodgeball 🎯.</p>
